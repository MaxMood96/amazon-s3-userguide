# Replicating objects created with server\-side encryption \(SSE\-C, SSE\-S3, SSE\-KMS\)<a name="replication-config-for-kms-objects"></a>

**Important**  
Amazon S3 now applies server\-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys \(SSE\-S3\) as the base level of encryption for every bucket in Amazon S3\. Starting January 5, 2023, all new object uploads to Amazon S3 will be automatically encrypted at no additional cost and with no impact on performance\. Currently, the automatic encryption status for S3 bucket default encryption configuration and for new object uploads is available in AWS CloudTrail logs, S3 Inventory, and S3 Storage Lens\. During the next few weeks, the automatic encryption status will also be rolled out to the Amazon S3 console and as an additional Amazon S3 API response header in the AWS Command Line Interface and AWS SDKs\. When this update is complete in all AWS Regions, we will update the documentation\. For more information, see [Default encryption FAQ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/default-encryption-faq.html)\.

By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server\-side encryption with customer managed keys stored in AWS KMS\. This section explains additional configuration that you add to direct Amazon S3 to replicate these objects\. 

**Note**  
You can use multi\-Region AWS KMS keys in Amazon S3\. However, Amazon S3 currently treats multi\-Region keys as though they were single\-Region keys, and does not use the multi\-Region features of the key\. For more information, see [ Using multi\-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

For an example with step\-by\-step instructions, see [Replicating encrypted objects](replication-walkthrough-4.md)\. For information about creating a replication configuration, see [Replicating objects](replication.md)\.

## Using default bucket encryption with replication<a name="replication-default-encryption"></a>

When you enable default encryption for a replication destination bucket, the following encryption behavior applies:
+ If objects in the source bucket are not encrypted, the replica objects in the destination bucket are encrypted using the default encryption settings of the destination bucket\. This results in the `ETag` of the source object being different from the `ETag` of the replica object\. You must update applications that use the `ETag` to accommodate for this difference\.
+ If objects in the source bucket are encrypted using SSE\-S3 or SSE\-KMS, the replica objects in the destination bucket use the same encryption as the source object encryption\. The default encryption settings of the destination bucket are not used\.

## Replicating encrypted objects \(SSE\-C\)<a name="replicationSSEC"></a>

By using server\-side encryption with customer\-provided keys \(SSE\-C\), you can manage proprietary keys\. With SSE\-C, you manage the keys while Amazon S3 manages the encryption and decryption process\. You must provide an encryption key as part of your request, but you don't need to write any code to perform object encryption or decryption\. When you upload an object, Amazon S3 encrypts the object by using the key that you provided\. Amazon S3 then purges that key from memory\. When you retrieve an object, you must provide the same encryption key as part of your request\. For more information, see [Using server\-side encryption with customer\-provided keys \(SSE\-C\)](ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.md)\.

S3 Replication supports objects that are encrypted with SSE\-C\. You can configure SSE\-C object replication in the Amazon S3 console or with the AWS SDKs, the same way that you configure replication for unencrypted objects\. S3 Replication automatically replicates newly uploaded SSE\-C encrypted objects if they are eligible, as per your S3 Replication configuration\. For replicating existing objects in your buckets, use S3 Batch Replication\. There aren't additional SSE\-C permissions beyond what are currently required for replication\. For more information about replicating objects, see [Setting up replication](replication-how-setup.md) and [Replicating existing objects with S3 Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-batch.md)\.

There are no additional charges for replicating SSE\-C objects\. For details about replication pricing, see the [Amazon S3 pricing page](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)\. 

## Replicating encrypted objects \(SSE\-S3, SSE\-KMS\)<a name="replications"></a>

By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server\-side encryption with AWS KMS keys stored in AWS KMS\. This section explains the additional configuration that you add to direct Amazon S3 to replicate these objects\. 

For an example with step\-by\-step instructions, see [Replicating encrypted objects](replication-walkthrough-4.md)\. For information about creating a replication configuration, see [Replicating objects](replication.md)\. 

### Specifying additional information in the replication configuration<a name="replication-kms-extra-config"></a>

In the replication configuration, you do the following:
+ In the `Destination` configuration, add the symmetric AWS KMS customer managed key that you want Amazon S3 to use to encrypt object replicas\. 
+ Explicitly opt in by enabling replication of objects encrypted by using KMS keys by adding the `SourceSelectionCriteria` element\.

 

```
<ReplicationConfiguration>
   <Rule>
      ...
      <SourceSelectionCriteria>
         <SseKmsEncryptedObjects>
           <Status>Enabled</Status>
         </SseKmsEncryptedObjects>
      </SourceSelectionCriteria>

      <Destination>
          ...
          <EncryptionConfiguration>
             <ReplicaKmsKeyID>AWS KMS key ID for the AWS Region of the destination bucket.</ReplicaKmsKeyID>
          </EncryptionConfiguration>
       </Destination>
      ...
   </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

**Important**  
The KMS key must have been created in the same AWS Region as the destination buckets\.   
The KMS key *must* be valid\. The `PUT` Bucket replication API operation doesn't check the validity of KMS keys\. If you use a KMS key that isn't valid, you will receive the HTTP 200 OK status code in response, but replication fails\.

The following example shows a replication configuration that includes optional configuration elements\.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ReplicationConfiguration>
   <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>
   <Rule>
      <ID>Rule-1</ID>
      <Priority>1</Priority>
      <Status>Enabled</Status>
      <DeleteMarkerReplication>
         <Status>Disabled</Status>
      </DeleteMarkerReplication>
      <Filter>
         <Prefix>Tax</Prefix>
      </Filter>
      <Destination>
         <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::destination-bucket</Bucket>
         <EncryptionConfiguration>
            <ReplicaKmsKeyID>The AWS KMS key ID for the AWS Region of the destination buckets. (S3 uses this key to encrypt object replicas.)</ReplicaKmsKeyID>
         </EncryptionConfiguration>
      </Destination>
      <SourceSelectionCriteria>
         <SseKmsEncryptedObjects>
            <Status>Enabled</Status>
         </SseKmsEncryptedObjects>
      </SourceSelectionCriteria>
   </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

This replication configuration has one rule\. The rule applies to objects with the `Tax` key prefix\. Amazon S3 uses the AWS KMS key ID to encrypt these object replicas\.

### Granting additional permissions for the IAM role<a name="replication-kms-permissions"></a>

 To replicate objects that are encrypted at rest by using AWS KMS, grant the following additional permissions to the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role that you specify in the replication configuration\. You grant these permissions by updating the permissions policy that's associated with the IAM role\. 
+ **`s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication` action for source objects** â€“ This action allows Amazon S3 to replicate both unencrypted objects and objects created with server\-side encryption by using SSE\-S3 keys or SSE\-KMS\.
**Note**  
We recommend that you use the `s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication` action instead of the `s3:GetObjectVersion` action because `s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication` provides Amazon S3 with only the minimum permissions necessary for replication\. In addition, the `s3:GetObjectVersion` action allows replication of unencrypted and SSE\-S3\-encrypted objects, but not of objects created by using SSE\-KMS\. 
+ **`kms:Decrypt` and `kms:Encrypt` AWS KMS actions for the KMS keys**
  + You must grant `kms:Decrypt` permissions for the AWS KMS key that's used to decrypt the source object\.
  + You must grant `kms:Encrypt` permissions for the AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt the object replica\.

We recommend that you restrict these permissions only to the destination buckets and objects by using AWS KMS condition keys\. The AWS account that owns the IAM role must have permissions for these AWS KMS actions \(`kms:Encrypt` and `kms:Decrypt`\) for the KMS keys that are listed in the policy\. If the KMS keys are owned by another AWS account, the owner of the KMS keys must grant these permissions to the AWS account that owns the IAM role\. For more information about managing access to these KMS keys, see [Using IAM Policies with AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html) in the* AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

### Amazon S3 Bucket Keys and replication<a name="bk-replication"></a>

To use replication with an S3 Bucket Key, the AWS KMS key policy for the KMS key that's used to encrypt the object replica must include `kms:Decrypt` permissions for the calling principal\. The call to `kms:Decrypt` verifies the integrity of the S3 Bucket Key before using it\. For more information, see [Using an S3 Bucket Key with replication](bucket-key.md#bucket-key-replication)\.

When an S3 Bucket Key is enabled for the source or destination bucket, the encryption context will be the bucket Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), not the object ARN \(for example, `arn:aws:s3:::bucket_ARN`\)\. You must update your IAM policies to use the bucket ARN for the encryption context:

```
"kms:EncryptionContext:aws:s3:arn": [
"arn:aws:s3:::bucket_ARN"
]
```

For more information, see [Encryption context \(x\-amz\-server\-side\-encryption\-context\)](specifying-kms-encryption.md#s3-kms-encryption-context) and [Changes to note before enabling an S3 Bucket Key](bucket-key.md#bucket-key-changes)\.

### Granting additional permissions for cross\-account scenarios<a name="replication-kms-cross-acct-scenario"></a>

In a cross\-account scenario, where the source and destination buckets are owned by different AWS accounts, you can use a KMS key to encrypt object replicas\. However, the KMS key owner must grant the source bucket owner permission to use the KMS key\. <a name="cross-acct-kms-key-permission"></a>

**To grant the source bucket owner permission to use the KMS key \(AWS KMSconsole\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS KMS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/kms](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms)\.

1. To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper\-right corner of the page\.

1.  To view the keys in your account that you create and manage, in the navigation pane choose **Customer managed keys**\.

1. Choose the KMS key\.

1. Under **General configuration**, choose the **Key policy** tab\.

1. Scroll down to **Other AWS accounts**\.

1. Choose **Add other AWS accounts**\.

1.  **arn:aws:iam::**, enter the source bucket account ID\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

**To grant the source bucket owner permission to use the KMS key \(AWS CLI\)**
+ For information about the AWS CLI command, see [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/put-key-policy.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/put-key-policy.html) in the* AWS CLI Command Reference*\. For information about the underlying API operation, see [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html) in the *[AWS Key Management Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/)\.*

### AWS KMS transaction quota considerations<a name="crr-kms-considerations"></a>

When you add many new objects with AWS KMS encryption after enabling Cross\-Region Replication \(CRR\), you might experience throttling \(HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors\)\. Throttling occurs when the number of AWS KMS transactions per second exceeds the current quota\. For more information, see [Quotas]( http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

To request a quota increase, use Service Quotas\. For more information, see [Amazon Web Services Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html)\. If Service Quotas isn't supported in your Region, [open an AWS Support case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/)\.
