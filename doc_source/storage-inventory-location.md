# Locating your inventory list<a name="storage-inventory-location"></a>

When an inventory list is published, the manifest files are published to the following location in the destination bucket\.

```
 destination-prefix/source-bucket/config-ID/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MMZ/manifest.json
 destination-prefix/source-bucket/config-ID/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MMZ/manifest.checksum
 destination-prefix/source-bucket/config-ID/hive/dt=YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM/symlink.txt
```
+ *destination\-prefix* is the \(object key name\) prefix set in the inventory configuration, which can be used to group all the inventory list files in a common location within the destination bucket\.
+ *source\-bucket* is the source bucket that the inventory list is for\. It is added to prevent collisions when multiple inventory reports from different source buckets are sent to the same destination bucket\.
+ *config\-ID* is added to prevent collisions with multiple inventory reports from the same source bucket that are sent to the same destination bucket\. The *config\-ID* comes from the inventory report configuration, and is the name for the report that is defined on setup\.
+ *YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH\-MMZ* is the timestamp that consists of the start time and the date when the inventory report generation begins scanning the bucket; for example, `2016-11-06T21-32Z`\.
+ `manifest.json` is the manifest file\. 
+ `manifest.checksum` is the MD5 of the content of the `manifest.json` file\. 
+ `symlink.txt` is the Apache Hive\-compatible manifest file\. 

The inventory lists are published daily or weekly to the following location in the destination bucket\.

```
      destination-prefix/source-bucket/config-ID/data/example-file-name.csv.gz
      ...
      destination-prefix/source-bucket/config-ID/data/example-file-name-1.csv.gz
```
+ `destination-prefix` is the \(object key name\) prefix set in the inventory configuration\. It can be used to group all the inventory list files in a common location in the destination bucket\.
+ `source-bucket` is the source bucket that the inventory list is for\. It is added to prevent collisions when multiple inventory reports from different source buckets are sent to the same destination bucket\.
+ `example-file-name``.csv.gz` is one of the CSV inventory files\. ORC inventory names end with the file name extension `.orc`, and Parquet inventory names end with the file name extension `.parquet`\.

  You can query an inventory list file with Amazon S3 Select\. In the Amazon S3 console, choose the name of the inventory list \(for example, *destination\-prefix*/*source\-bucket*/*config\-ID*/data/*example\-file\-name\.csv\.gz*\)\. Then, choose **Object actions** and **Query with S3 Select**\. For an example of how to use an S3 Select aggregate function to query an inventory list file, see [SUM example](s3-select-sql-reference-aggregate.md#s3-select-sql-reference-aggregate-case-examples)\.

## Inventory manifest<a name="storage-inventory-location-manifest"></a>

The manifest files `manifest.json` and `symlink.txt` describe where the inventory files are located\. Whenever a new inventory list is delivered, it is accompanied by a new set of manifest files\. These files may overwrite each other\. In versioning\-enabled buckets, Amazon S3 creates new versions of the manifest files\. 

Each manifest contained in the `manifest.json` file provides metadata and other basic information about an inventory\. This information includes the following:
+ Source bucket name
+ Destination bucket name
+ Version of the inventory
+ Creation timestamp in the epoch date format that consists of the start time and the date when the inventory report generation begins scanning the bucket
+ Format and schema of the inventory files
+ Actual list of the inventory files that are in the destination bucket

Whenever a `manifest.json` file is written, it is accompanied by a `manifest.checksum` file that is the MD5 of the content of `manifest.json` file\.

**Example Inventory manifest in a manifest\.json file**  
The following examples show an inventory manifest in a `manifest.json` file for a CSV, ORC, and Parquet\-formatted inventories\.  
The following is an example of a manifest in a `manifest.json` file for a CSV\-formatted inventory\.

The `symlink.txt` file is an Apache Hive\-compatible manifest file that allows Hive to automatically discover inventory files and their associated data files\. The Hive\-compatible manifest works with the Hive\-compatible services Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum\. It also works with Hive\-compatible applications, including [Presto](https://prestodb.io/), [https://hive.apache.org/](https://hive.apache.org/), [https://databricks.com/spark/about/](https://databricks.com/spark/about/), and many others\.  
The `symlink.txt` Apache Hive\-compatible manifest file does not currently work with AWS Glue\.  
Reading `symlink.txt` with [https://hive.apache.org/](https://hive.apache.org/) and [https://databricks.com/spark/about/](https://databricks.com/spark/about/) is not supported for ORC and Parquet\-formatted inventory files\.
