# Monitor S3 Storage Lens metrics in CloudWatch<a name="storage_lens_view_metrics_cloudwatch"></a>

You can publish S3 Storage Lens metrics to Amazon CloudWatch to create a unified view of your operational health in [CloudWatch dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html)\. You can also use CloudWatch features, such as alarms and triggered actions, metric math, and anomaly detection, to monitor and take action on S3 Storage Lens metrics\. In addition, CloudWatch API operations enable applications, including third\-party providers, to access your S3 Storage Lens metrics\. For more information about CloudWatch features, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html)\.

You can enable the CloudWatch publishing option for new or existing dashboard configurations by using the Amazon S3 console, Amazon S3 REST API, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs\. Dashboards that are upgraded to S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics and recommendations can use the CloudWatch publishing option\. For S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics and recommendations pricing, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)\. No additional CloudWatch metrics publishing charges apply; however, other CloudWatch charges, such as dashboards, alarms, and API calls, do apply\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\. 

S3 Storage Lens metrics are published to CloudWatch in the account that owns the S3 Storage Lens configuration\. After you enable the CloudWatch publishing option within advanced metrics and recommendations, you can access organization, account, and bucket\-level metrics in CloudWatch\. Prefix\-level metrics are not available in CloudWatch\.

**Note**  
S3 Storage Lens metrics are daily metrics and are published to CloudWatch once per day\. When you query S3 Storage Lens metrics in CloudWatch, the period for the query must be 1 day \(86400 seconds\)\. After your daily S3 Storage Lens metrics appear in your S3 Storage Lens dashboard in the Amazon S3 console, it can take a few hours for these same metrics to appear in CloudWatch\. When you enable the CloudWatch publishing option for S3 Storage Lens metrics for the first time, it can take up to 24 hours for your metrics to publish to CloudWatch\. 

After you enable the CloudWatch publishing option, you can use the following CloudWatch features to monitor and analyze your S3 Storage LensStorage Lens data:
+ [Dashboards](storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch.md#storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch-dashboards) – Use CloudWatch dashboards to create customized S3 Storage Lens dashboards\. Share your CloudWatch dashboard with people who don't have direct access to your AWS account, across teams, with stakeholders, and with people external to your organizations\. 
+ [Alarms and triggered actions](storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch.md#storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch-alarms) – Configure alarms that watch metrics and take action when a threshold is breached\. For example, you can configure an alarm that sends an Amazon SNS notification when the **Incomplete Multipart Upload Bytes** metric exceeds 1 GB for three consecutive days\. 
+ [Anomaly detection](storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch.md#storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch-alarms) – Enable anomaly detection to continuously analyze metrics, determine normal baselines, and surface anomalies\. You can create an anomaly detection alarm based on the expected value of a metric\. For example, you can monitor anomalies for the **Object Lock Enabled Bytes** metric to detect unauthorized removal of Object Lock settings\.
+ [Metric math](storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch.md#storage-lens-cloudwatch-monitoring-cloudwatch-metric-math) – You can also use metric math to query multiple S3 Storage Lens metrics and use math expressions to create new time series based on these metrics\. For example, you can create a new metric to get the average object size by dividing `StorageBytes` by `ObjectCount`\.
