# Working with objects in a versioning\-enabled bucket<a name="manage-objects-versioned-bucket"></a>

Objects that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket before you set the versioning state have a version ID of `null`\. When you enable versioning, existing objects in your bucket do not change\. What changes is how Amazon S3 handles the objects in future requests\.

**Transitioning object versions**  
You can define lifecycle configuration rules for objects that have a well\-defined lifecycle to transition object versions to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class at a specific time in the object's lifetime\. For more information, see [Managing your storage lifecycle](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)\.

The topics in this section explain various object operations in a versioning\-enabled bucket\. For more information about versioning, see [Using versioning in S3 buckets](Versioning.md)\.
