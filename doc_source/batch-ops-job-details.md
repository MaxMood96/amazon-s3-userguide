# Viewing job details<a name="batch-ops-job-details"></a>

If you want more information about a job than you can retrieve by listing jobs, you can view all of the details for a single job\. In addition to the information returned in a job list, a single job's details include other items, such as: 
+ The operation parameters
+ Details about the manifest
+ Information about the completion report \(if you configured one when you created the job\)
+ The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the user role that you assigned to run the job

By viewing an individual job's details, you can access a job's entire configuration\. To view a jobâ€™s details, you can use the Amazon S3 console or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\.
