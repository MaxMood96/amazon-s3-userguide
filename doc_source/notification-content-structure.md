# Event message structure<a name="notification-content-structure"></a>

The notification message that Amazon S3 sends to publish an event is in the JSON format\.

For a general overview and instructions on configuring event notifications, see [Amazon S3 Event Notifications](EventNotifications.md)\.

This example shows *version 2\.2* of the event notification JSON structure\. Amazon S3 uses *versions 2\.1*, *2\.2*, and *2\.3* of this event structure\. Amazon S3 uses version 2\.2 for cross\-Region replication event notifications\. It uses version 2\.3 for S3 Lifecycle, S3 Intelligent\-Tiering, object ACL, object tagging, and object restoration delete events\. These versions contain extra information specific to these operations\. Versions 2\.2 and 2\.3 are otherwise compatible with version 2\.1, which Amazon S3 currently uses for all other event notification types\.

Note the following about the event message structure:
+ The `eventVersion` key value contains a major and minor version in the form `<major>`\.`<minor>`\.

  The major version is incremented if Amazon S3 makes a change to the event structure that's not backward compatible\. This includes removing a JSON field that's already present or changing how the contents of a field are represented \(for example, a date format\)\.

  The minor version is incremented if Amazon S3 adds new fields to the event structure\. This might occur if new information is provided for some or all existing events\. This might also occur if new information is provided on only newly introduced event types\. Applications should ignore new fields to stay forward compatible with new minor versions of the event structure\.

  If new event types are introduced but the structure of the event is otherwise unmodified, the event version doesn't change\.

  To ensure that your applications can parse the event structure correctly, we recommend that you do an equal\-to comparison on the major version number\. To ensure that the fields that are expected by your application are present, we also recommend doing a greater\-than\-or\-equal\-to comparison on the minor version\.
+ The `eventName` references the list of [event notification types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/notification-how-to-event-types-and-destinations.html) but doesn't contain the `s3:` prefix\.
+ The `responseElements` key value is useful if you want to trace a request by following up with AWS Support\. Both `x-amz-request-id` and `x-amz-id-2` help Amazon S3 trace an individual request\. These values are the same as those that Amazon S3 returns in the response to the request that initiates the events\. This is so they can be used to match the event to the request\.
+ The `s3` key provides information about the bucket and object involved in the event\. The object key name value is URL encoded\. For example, "red flower\.jpg" becomes "red\+flower\.jpg" \(Amazon S3 returns "`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`" as the content type in the response\)\.
+ The `sequencer` key provides a way to determine the sequence of events\. Event notifications aren't guaranteed to arrive in the same order that the events occurred\. However, notifications from events that create objects \(`PUT`s\) and delete objects contain a `sequencer`\. It can be used to determine the order of events for a given object key\. 

  If you compare the `sequencer` strings from two event notifications on the same object key, the event notification with the greater `sequencer` hexadecimal value is the event that occurred later\. If you're using event notifications to maintain a separate database or index of your Amazon S3 objects, we recommend that you compare and store the `sequencer` values as you process each event notification\. 

  Note the following:
  + You can't use `sequencer` to determine order for events on different object keys\.
  + The sequencers can be of different lengths\. So, to compare these values, first right pad the shorter value with zeros, and then do a lexicographical comparison\.
+ The `glacierEventData` key is only visible for `s3:ObjectRestore:Completed` events\. 
+ The `restoreEventData` key contains attributes that are related to your restore request\.
+ The `replicationEventData` key is only visible for replication events\.
+ The `intelligentTieringEventData` key is only visible for S3 Intelligent\-Tiering events\.
+ The `lifecycleEventData` key is only visible for S3 Lifecycle transition events\.
