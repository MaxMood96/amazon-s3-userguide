# Getting started by using the AWS CLI and SDK for Java<a name="S3OutpostsGSCLIJava"></a>

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily store and retrieve objects on premises for applications that require local data access, local data processing, and data residency\. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts \(`OUTPOSTS`\), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store data durably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts\. You communicate with your Outpost bucket by using an access point and endpoint connection over a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. You can use the same APIs and features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3 buckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging\. You can use S3 on Outposts through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), AWS SDKs, or REST API\. For more information, see [What is Amazon S3 on Outposts?](S3onOutposts.md)

To get started with S3 on Outposts, you must create a bucket, an access point, and an endpoint\. Then, you can upload objects to your bucket\. The following examples show you how to get started with S3 on Outposts by using the AWS CLI and SDK for Java\. To get started by using the console, see [Getting started by using the AWS Management Console](S3OutpostsGSConsole.md)\.

## Step 1: Create a bucket<a name="S3OutpostsGSCreateBucket"></a>

The following AWS CLI and SDK for Java examples show you how to create an S3 on Outposts bucket\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Example**  
The following example creates an S3 on Outposts bucket \(`s3-outposts:CreateBucket`\) by using the AWS CLI\. To run this command, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information\.  

```
aws s3control create-bucket --bucket example-outposts-bucket --outpost-id op-01ac5d28a6a232904
```

------
#### [ SDK for Java ]

**Example**  
The following example creates an S3 on Outposts bucket \(`s3-outposts:CreateBucket`\) by using the SDK for Java\.   

```
import com.amazonaws.services.s3control.model.*;

public String createBucket(String bucketName) {

    CreateBucketRequest reqCreateBucket = new CreateBucketRequest()
            .withBucket(bucketName)
            .withOutpostId(OutpostId)
            .withCreateBucketConfiguration(new CreateBucketConfiguration());

    CreateBucketResult respCreateBucket = s3ControlClient.createBucket(reqCreateBucket);
    System.out.printf("CreateBucket Response: %s%n", respCreateBucket.toString());

    return respCreateBucket.getBucketArn();

}
```

------

## Step 2: Create an access point<a name="S3OutpostsGSCreateAccessPoint"></a>

To access your Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, you must create and configure an access point\. These examples how you how to create an access point by using the AWS CLI and the SDK for Java\.

Access points simplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets in Amazon S3\. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform Amazon S3 object operations, such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`\. With S3 on Outposts, you must use access points to access any object in an Outposts bucket\. Access points support only virtual\-host\-style addressing\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Example**  
The following AWS CLI example creates an access point for an Outposts bucket\. To run this command, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information\.  

```
aws s3control create-access-point --account-id 123456789012 --name example-outposts-access-point --bucket "arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outposts-bucket" --vpc-configuration VpcId=example-vpc-12345
```

------
#### [ SDK for Java ]

**Example**  
The following SDK for Java example creates an access point for an Outposts bucket\. To use this example, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information\.  

```
import com.amazonaws.services.s3control.model.*;

public String createAccessPoint(String bucketArn, String accessPointName) {

    CreateAccessPointRequest reqCreateAP = new CreateAccessPointRequest()
            .withAccountId(AccountId)
            .withBucket(bucketArn)
            .withName(accessPointName)
            .withVpcConfiguration(new VpcConfiguration().withVpcId("vpc-12345"));

    CreateAccessPointResult respCreateAP = s3ControlClient.createAccessPoint(reqCreateAP);
    System.out.printf("CreateAccessPoint Response: %s%n", respCreateAP.toString());

    return respCreateAP.getAccessPointArn();

}
```

------

## Step 3: Create an endpoint<a name="S3OutpostsGSCreateEndpoint"></a>

To route requests to an Amazon S3 on Outposts access point, you must create and configure an S3 on Outposts endpoint\. In order to create an endpoint, you will need an active connection with your service link to your Outposts home region\. Each virtual private cloud \(VPC\) on your Outpost can have one associated endpoint\. For more information about endpoint quotas, see [ S3 on Outposts network requirements](S3OnOutpostsRestrictionsLimitations.md#S3OnOutpostsConnectivityRestrictions)\. You must create an endpoint to be able to access your Outposts buckets and perform object operations\. For more information, see [Endpoints](S3OutpostsWorkingBuckets.md#S3OutpostsEP)\.

These examples show you how to create an endpoint by using the AWS CLI and the SDK for Java\. For more information about the permissions required to create and manage endpoints, see [Permissions for S3 on Outposts endpoints](S3OutpostsIAM.md#S3OutpostsEndpointPermissions)\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Example**  
The following AWS CLI example creates an endpoint for an Outpost by using the VPC resource access type\. The VPC is derived from the subnet\. To run this command, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information\.  

```
aws s3outposts create-endpoint --outpost-id op-01ac5d28a6a232904 --subnet-id subnet-8c7a57c5 --security-group-id sg-ab19e0d1
```
The following AWS CLI example creates an endpoint for an Outpost by using the customer\-owned IP address pool \(CoIP pool\) access type\. To run this command, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information\.  

```
aws s3outposts create-endpoint --outpost-id op-01ac5d28a6a232904 --subnet-id subnet-8c7a57c5 --security-group-id sg-ab19e0d1 --access-type CustomerOwnedIp --customer-owned-ipv4-pool ipv4pool-coip-12345678901234567
```

------
#### [ SDK for Java ]

**Example**  
The following SDK for Java example creates an endpoint for an Outpost\. To use this example, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information\.  

```
import com.amazonaws.services.s3outposts.AmazonS3Outposts;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3outposts.AmazonS3OutpostsClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3outposts.model.CreateEndpointRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3outposts.model.CreateEndpointResult;

public void createEndpoint() {
    AmazonS3Outposts s3OutpostsClient = AmazonS3OutpostsClientBuilder
                .standard().build();
                
    CreateEndpointRequest createEndpointRequest = new CreateEndpointRequest()
                .withOutpostId("op-0d79779cef3c30a40")
                .withSubnetId("subnet-8c7a57c5")
                .withSecurityGroupId("sg-ab19e0d1")		
                .withAccessType("CustomerOwnedIp")   
                .withCustomerOwnedIpv4Pool("ipv4pool-coip-12345678901234567");
    // Use .withAccessType and .withCustomerOwnedIpv4Pool only when the access type is 
    // customer-owned IP address pool (CoIP pool) 
    CreateEndpointResult createEndpointResult = s3OutpostsClient.createEndpoint(createEndpointRequest);
    System.out.println("Endpoint is created and its ARN is " + createEndpointResult.getEndpointArn());
}
```

## Step 4: Upload an object to an S3 on Outposts bucket<a name="S3OutpostsUploadObjects"></a>

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3 on Outposts\. Every object is contained in a bucket\. You must use access points to access any object in an Outpost bucket\. When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the access point Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) or the access point alias\. For more information about access point aliases, see [Using a bucket\-style alias for your S3 on Outposts bucket access point](s3-outposts-access-points-alias.md)\.

The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts access points, which includes the AWS Region code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to, the AWS account ID, the Outpost ID, and the access point name:

```
arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name
```

For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [Resource ARNs for S3 on Outposts](S3OutpostsIAM.md#S3OutpostsARN)\.

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost\. When AWS installs an Outpost rack, your data stays local to your Outpost to meet data\-residency requirements\. Your objects never leave your Outpost and are not in an AWS Region\. Because the AWS Management Console is hosted in\-Region, you can't use the console to upload or manage objects in your Outpost\. However, you can use the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), and AWS SDKs to upload and manage your objects through your access points\.

The following AWS CLI and AWS SDK for Java examples show you how to upload an object to an S3 on Outposts bucket by using an access point\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Example**  
The following example puts an object named `sample-object.xml` into an S3 on Outposts bucket \(`s3-outposts:PutObject`\) by using the AWS CLI\. To use this command, replace each `user input placeholder` with your own information\. For more information about this command, see [put\-object](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html) in the *AWS CLI Reference*\.  

```
aws s3api put-object --bucket arn:aws:s3-outposts:Region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/accesspoint/example-outposts-access-point --key sample-object.xml --body sample-object.xml
```

------
#### [ SDK for Java ]

**Example**  
The following example puts an object into an S3 on Outposts bucket by using the SDK for Java\. To use this example, replace each `user input placeholder` with your own information\. For more information, see [Uploading objects](upload-objects.md)\.

        } catch (AmazonServiceException e) {
            // The call was transmitted successfully, but Amazon S3 couldn't process
            // it, so it returned an error response.
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (SdkClientException e) {
            // Amazon S3 couldn't be contacted for a response, or the client
            // couldn't parse the response from Amazon S3.
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
