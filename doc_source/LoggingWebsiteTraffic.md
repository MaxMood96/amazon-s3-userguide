# \(Optional\) Logging web traffic<a name="LoggingWebsiteTraffic"></a>

You can optionally enable Amazon S3 server access logging for a bucket that is configured as a static website\. Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to your bucket\. For more information, see [Logging requests using server access logging](ServerLogs.md)\. If you plan to use Amazon CloudFront to [speed up your website](website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.md), you can also use CloudFront logging\. For more information, see [Configuring and Using Access Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*\.

**To enable server access logging for your static website bucket**

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the same Region where you created the bucket that is configured as a static website, create a bucket for logging, for example `logs.example.com`\.

1. Create a folder for the server access logging log files \(for example, `logs`\)\.

1. \(Optional\) If you want to use CloudFront to improve your website performance, create a folder for the CloudFront log files \(for example, `cdn`\)\.

   For more information, see [Speeding up your website with Amazon CloudFront](website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.md)\.
