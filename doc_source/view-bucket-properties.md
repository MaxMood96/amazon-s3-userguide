   + **Bucket Versioning** – Keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket by using versioning\. By default, versioning is disabled for a new bucket\. For information about enabling versioning, see [Enabling versioning on buckets](manage-versioning-examples.md)\.
   + **Tags** – With AWS cost allocation, you can use bucket tags to annotate billing for your use of a bucket\. A tag is a key\-value pair that represents a label that you assign to a bucket\. To add tags, choose **Tags**, and then choose **Add tag**\. For more information, see [Using cost allocation S3 bucket tags](CostAllocTagging.md)\. 
   + **Default encryption** – Enabling default encryption provides you with automatic server\-side encryption\.

For more information, see [Setting default server\-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets](bucket-encryption.md)\. 
   + **Server access logging** – Get detailed records for the requests that are made to your bucket with server access logging\. By default, Amazon S3 doesn't collect server access logs\. For information about enabling server access logging, see [Enabling Amazon S3 server access logging](enable-server-access-logging.md)
   + **AWS CloudTrail data events** – Use CloudTrail to log data events\. By default, trails don't log data events\. Additional charges apply for data events\. For more information, see [Logging Data Events for Trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*\.
   + **Event notifications** – Enable certain Amazon S3 bucket events to send notification messages to a destination whenever the events occur\. To enable events, choose **Create event notification**, and then specify the settings you want to use\. For more information, see [Enabling and configuring event notifications using the Amazon S3 consoleEnabling Amazon EventBridge](enable-event-notifications.md)\.
   + **Transfer acceleration** – Enable fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket\. For information about enabling transfer acceleration, see [Enabling and using S3 Transfer Acceleration](transfer-acceleration-examples.md)\.
