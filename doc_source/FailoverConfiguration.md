# Amazon S3 Multi\-Region Access Points routing states<a name="FailoverConfiguration"></a>

Your Amazon S3 Multi\-Region Access Points failover configuration determines the routing status of the AWS Regions that are used with the Multi\-Region Access Point\. You can configure your Amazon S3 Multi\-Region Access Point to be in an active\-active state or active\-passive state\.
+ **Active\-active** – In an active\-active configuration, all requests are automatically sent to the closest proximity AWS Region in your Multi\-Region Access Point\. After the Multi\-Region Access Point has been configured to be in an active\-active state, all Regions can receive traffic\. If traffic disruption occurs in an active\-active configuration, network traffic will automatically be redirected to one of the active Regions\.
+ **Active\-passive** – In an active\-passive configuration, the active Regions in your Multi\-Region Access Point receive traffic and the passive ones do not\. If you intend to use S3 failover controls to initiate failover in a disaster situation, set up your Multi\-Region Access Points in an active\-passive configuration while you're testing and performing disaster\-recovery planning\.
