# Deleting a single object<a name="delete-objects"></a>

You can use the Amazon S3 console or the DELETE API to delete a single existing object from an S3 bucket\. For more information about deleting objects in Amazon S3, see [Deleting Amazon S3 objects](DeletingObjects.md)\.

Because all objects in your S3 bucket incur storage costs, you should delete objects that you no longer need\. For example, if you are collecting log files, it's a good idea to delete them when they're no longer needed\. You can set up a lifecycle rule to automatically delete objects such as log files\. For more information, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.md)\.

For information about Amazon S3 features and pricing, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing)\.

## Using the S3 console<a name="delete-object-console"></a>

Follow these steps to use the Amazon S3 console to delete a single object from a bucket\.

**To delete an object**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the **Bucket name** list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to delete an object from\.

1. To delete an object in a versioning\-enabled bucket with versioning: 
   + **Disabled**, Amazon S3 creates a delete marker\. To delete the object, select the object, and choose **delete** and confirm your choice by typing **delete** in the text field\.
   + **Enabled**, Amazon S3 will permanently delete the object version\. Select the object version that you want to delete, and choose **delete** and confirm your choice by typing **permanently delete** in the text field\.

## Using the AWS SDKs<a name="DeletingOneObject"></a>

The following examples show how you can use the AWS SDKs to delete an object from a bucket\. For more information, see [DELETE Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*

If you have S3 Versioning enabled on the bucket, you have the following options:
+ Delete a specific object version by specifying a version ID\.
+ Delete an object without specifying a version ID, in which case Amazon S3 adds a delete marker to the object\.

For more information about S3 Versioning, see [Using versioning in S3 buckets](Versioning.md)\.

#### [ Java ]

**Example 1: Deleting an object \(non\-versioned bucket\)**  
The following example assumes that the bucket is not versioning\-enabled and the object doesn't have any version IDs\. In the delete request, you specify only the object key and not a version ID\.   
For instructions on creating and testing a working sample, see [Testing the Amazon S3 Java Code Examples](UsingTheMPJavaAPI.md#TestingJavaSamples)\.

public class DeleteObjectNonVersionedBucket {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Regions clientRegion = Regions.DEFAULT_REGION;
        String bucketName = "*** Bucket name ***";
        String keyName = "*** Key name ****";

        try {
            AmazonS3 s3Client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
                    .withCredentials(new ProfileCredentialsProvider())
                    .withRegion(clientRegion)
                    .build();

            s3Client.deleteObject(new DeleteObjectRequest(bucketName, keyName));
        } catch (AmazonServiceException e) {
            // The call was transmitted successfully, but Amazon S3 couldn't process 
            // it, so it returned an error response.
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (SdkClientException e) {
            // Amazon S3 couldn't be contacted for a response, or the client
            // couldn't parse the response from Amazon S3.
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 2: Deleting an object \(versioned bucket\)**  
The following example deletes an object from a versioned bucket\. The example deletes a specific object version by specifying the object key name and version ID\.   
The example does the following:  

1. Adds a sample object to the bucket\. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the newly added object\. The example uses this version ID in the delete request\.

1. Deletes the object version by specifying both the object key name and a version ID\. If there are no other versions of that object, Amazon S3 deletes the object entirely\. Otherwise, Amazon S3 only deletes the specified version\.
**Note**  
You can get the version IDs of an object by sending a `ListVersions` request\.

#### [ \.NET ]

The following examples show how to delete an object from both versioned and non\-versioned buckets\. For more information about S3 Versioning, see [Using versioning in S3 buckets](Versioning.md)\. 

**Example Deleting an object from a non\-versioned bucket**  
The following C\# example deletes an object from a non\-versioned bucket\. The example assumes that the objects don't have version IDs, so you don't specify version IDs\. You specify only the object key\.   
For information about how to create and test a working sample, see [Running the Amazon S3 \.NET Code Examples](UsingTheMPDotNetAPI.md#TestingDotNetApiSamples)\.

        private const string bucketName = "*** bucket name ***"; 
        private const string keyName = "*** object key ***";
        // Specify your bucket region (an example region is shown).

                    BucketName = bucketName,
                    Key = keyName
                };

                Console.WriteLine("Deleting an object");
                await client.DeleteObjectAsync(deleteObjectRequest);
            }
            catch (AmazonS3Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error encountered on server. Message:'{0}' when deleting an object", e.Message);

            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Example Deleting an object from a versioned bucket**  
The following C\# example deletes an object from a versioned bucket\. It deletes a specific version of the object by specifying the object key name and version ID\.   
The code performs the following tasks:  

1. Enables S3 Versioning on a bucket that you specify \(if S3 Versioning is already enabled, this has no effect\)\.

1. Adds a sample object to the bucket\. In response, Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the newly added object\. The example uses this version ID in the delete request\.

1. Deletes the sample object by specifying both the object key name and a version ID\.
**Note**  
You can also get the version ID of an object by sending a `ListVersions` request\.  

   ```
   var listResponse = client.ListVersions(new ListVersionsRequest { BucketName = bucketName, Prefix = keyName }); 
   ```

#### [ PHP ]

This example shows how to use classes from version 3 of the AWS SDK for PHP to delete an object from a non\-versioned bucket\. For information about deleting an object from a versioned bucket, see [Using the REST API](DeletingAnObjectsUsingREST.md)\. 

This example assumes that you are already following the instructions for [Using the AWS SDK for PHP and Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md) and have the AWS SDK for PHP properly installed\. For information about running the PHP examples in this guide, see [Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md#running-php-samples)\.

The following PHP example deletes an object from a bucket\. Because this example shows how to delete objects from non\-versioned buckets, it provides only the bucket name and object key \(not a version ID\) in the delete request\. 

```
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;
use Aws\S3\Exception\S3Exception;

$bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';
$keyname = '*** Your Object Key ***';

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

// 1. Delete the object from the bucket.
try
{
    echo 'Attempting to delete ' . $keyname . '...' . PHP_EOL;

    $result = $s3->deleteObject([
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key'    => $keyname
    ]);

    if ($result['DeleteMarker'])
    {
        echo $keyname . ' was deleted or does not exist.' . PHP_EOL;
    } else {
        exit('Error: ' . $keyname . ' was not deleted.' . PHP_EOL);
    }
}
catch (S3Exception $e) {
    exit('Error: ' . $e->getAwsErrorMessage() . PHP_EOL);
}

// 2. Check to see if the object was deleted.
try
{
    echo 'Checking to see if ' . $keyname . ' still exists...' . PHP_EOL;

    $result = $s3->getObject([
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key'    => $keyname
    ]);

    echo 'Error: ' . $keyname . ' still exists.';
}
catch (S3Exception $e) {
    exit($e->getAwsErrorMessage());
}
```

#### [ Javascript ]

This example shows how to use version 3 of the AWS SDK for JavaScript to delete an object\. For more information about AWS SDK for JavaScript see, [Using the AWS SDK for JavaScript](using-aws-javascript.md)\.

```
import { DeleteObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { s3Client } from "./libs/s3Client.js" // Helper function that creates Amazon S3 service client module.

export const bucketParams = { Bucket: "BUCKET_NAME", Key: "KEY" };

export const run = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await s3Client.send(new DeleteObjectCommand(bucketParams));
    console.log("Success. Object deleted.", data);
    return data; // For unit tests.
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error", err);
  }
};
run();
```

## Using the AWS CLI<a name="delete-object-cli"></a>



To delete one object per request, use the `DELETE` API\. For more information, see [DELETE Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html)\. For more information about using the CLI to delete an object, see [delete\-object](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/2.0.34/reference/s3api/delete-object.html)\.
