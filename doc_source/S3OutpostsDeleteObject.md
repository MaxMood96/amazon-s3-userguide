# Deleting objects in Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets<a name="S3OutpostsDeleteObject"></a>

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3 on Outposts\. Every object is contained in a bucket\. You must use access points to access any object in an Outpost bucket\. When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the access point Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) or the access point alias\. For more information about access point aliases, see [Using a bucket\-style alias for your S3 on Outposts bucket access point](s3-outposts-access-points-alias.md)\.

The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts access points, which includes the AWS Region code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to, the AWS account ID, the Outpost ID, and the access point name:

```
arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name
```

For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [Resource ARNs for S3 on Outposts](S3OutpostsIAM.md#S3OutpostsARN)\.

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost\. When AWS installs an Outpost rack, your data stays local to your Outpost to meet data\-residency requirements\. Your objects never leave your Outpost and are not in an AWS Region\. Because the AWS Management Console is hosted in\-Region, you can't use the console to upload or manage objects in your Outpost\. However, you can use the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), and AWS SDKs to upload and manage your objects through your access points\.

The following examples show you how to delete a single object or multiple objects in an S3 on Outposts bucket by using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) and AWS SDK for Java\.

## Using the AWS CLI<a name="S3OutpostsDeleteObjectsCLI"></a>

The following examples show you how to delete a single object or multiple objects from an S3 on Outposts bucket\.







------
#### [ delete\-object ]

The following example deletes an object named `sample-object.xml` from an S3 on Outposts bucket \(`s3-outposts:DeleteObject`\) by using the AWS CLI\. To use this command, replace each `user input placeholder` with your own information\. For more information about this command, see [delete\-object](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/delete-object.html) in the *AWS CLI Reference*\.

```
aws s3api delete-object --bucket arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/accesspoint/example-outposts-access-point --key sample-object.xml
```

------
#### [ delete\-objects ]

The following example deletes two objects named `sample-object.xml` and `test1.text` from an S3 on Outposts bucket \(`s3-outposts:DeleteObject`\) by using the AWS CLI\. To use this command, replace each `user input placeholder` with your own information\. For more information about this command, see [delete\-objects](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/delete-objects.html) in the *AWS CLI Reference*\.

```
aws s3api delete-objects --bucket arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/accesspoint/example-outposts-access-point --delete file://delete.json

    },

    }
  ],
  "Quiet": false

## Using the AWS SDK for Java<a name="S3OutpostsDeleteObjectsJava"></a>

The following examples show you how to delete a single object or multiple objects from an S3 on Outposts bucket\.

------
#### [ DeleteObject ]

The following S3 on Outposts example deletes an object in a bucket by using the SDK for Java\. To use this example, specify the access point ARN for the Outpost and the key name for the object that you want to delete\. For more information, see [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference*\.
