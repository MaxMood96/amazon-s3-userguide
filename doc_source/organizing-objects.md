# Organizing, listing, and working with your objects<a name="organizing-objects"></a>

In Amazon S3, you can use prefixes to organize your storage\. A prefix is a logical grouping of the objects in a bucket\. The prefix value is similar to a directory name that enables you to store similar data under the same directory in a bucket\. When you programmatically upload objects, you can use prefixes to organize your data\.

In the Amazon S3 console, prefixes are called folders\. You can view all your objects and folders in the S3 console by navigating to a bucket\. You can also view information about each object, including object properties\.

For more information about listing and organizing your data in Amazon S3, see the following topics\.
