# Deleting multiple objects<a name="delete-multiple-objects"></a>

Because all objects in your S3 bucket incur storage costs, you should delete objects that you no longer need\. For example, if you are collecting log files, it's a good idea to delete them when they're no longer needed\. You can set up a lifecycle rule to automatically delete objects such as log files\. For more information, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.md)\.

For information about Amazon S3 features and pricing, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing)\.

You can use the Amazon S3 console or the Multi\-Object Delete API to delete multiple objects simultaneously from an S3 bucket\.

## Using the S3 console<a name="delete-objects-console"></a>

Follow these steps to use the Amazon S3 console to delete multiple objects from a bucket\.

**To delete objects**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. Navigate to the Amazon S3 bucket or folder that contains the objects that you want to delete\.

1. Select the check box to the left of the names of the objects that you want to delete\.

1. Choose **Actions** and choose **Delete** from the list of options that appears\.

   Alternatively, choose **Delete** from the options in the upper right\. 

1. Enter **delete** if asked to confirm that you want to delete these objects\.

1. Choose **Delete objects** in the bottom right and Amazon S3 deletes the specified objects\.

**Warning**  
Deleting the specified objects cannot be undone\.
This action deletes all specified objects\. When deleting folders, wait for the delete action to finish before adding new objects to the folder\. Otherwise, new objects might be deleted as well\.
To delete an object in a bucket with bucket versioning **disabled** or **suspended**, Amazon S3 creates a delete marker\. To undo the delete action, delete this delete marker\. To confirm this action, type **permanently delete**\.
To delete an object version in a bucket with bucket versioning **enabled**, Amazon S3 will permanently delete the object version\. To confirm this action, type **delete**\.

## Using the AWS SDKs<a name="DeletingMultipleObjects"></a>

Amazon S3 provides the Multi\-Object Delete API, which you can use to delete multiple objects in a single request\. The API supports two modes for the response: *verbose* and *quiet*\. By default, the operation uses verbose mode\. In verbose mode, the response includes the result of the deletion of each key that is specified in your request\. In quiet mode, the response includes only keys for which the delete operation encountered an error\. If all keys are successfully deleted when you're using quiet mode, Amazon S3 returns an empty response\. For more information, see [Delete \- Multi\-Object Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/multiobjectdeleteapi.html)\.

To learn more about object deletion, see [Deleting Amazon S3 objects](DeletingObjects.md)\.

#### [ Java ]

The AWS SDK for Java provides the `AmazonS3Client.deleteObjects()` method for deleting multiple objects\. For each object that you want to delete, you specify the key name\. If the bucket is versioning\-enabled, you have the following options:
+ Specify only the object's key name\. Amazon S3 adds a delete marker to the object\.
+ Specify both the object's key name and a version ID to be deleted\. Amazon S3 deletes the specified version of the object\.

**Example**  
The following example uses the Multi\-Object Delete API to delete objects from a bucket that is not version\-enabled\. The example uploads sample objects to the bucket and then uses the `AmazonS3Client.deleteObjects()` method to delete the objects in a single request\. In the `DeleteObjectsRequest`, the example specifies only the object key names because the objects do not have version IDs\.   
For instructions on creating and testing a working sample, see [Testing the Amazon S3 Java Code Examples](UsingTheMPJavaAPI.md#TestingJavaSamples)\.

**Example**  
The following example uses the Multi\-Object Delete API to delete objects from a version\-enabled bucket\. It does the following:   

1. Creates sample objects and then deletes them, specifying the key name and version ID for each object to delete\. The operation deletes only the specified object versions\.

1. Creates sample objects and then deletes them by specifying only the key names\. Because the example doesn't specify version IDs, the operation adds a delete marker to each object, without deleting any specific object versions\. After the delete markers are added, these objects will not appear in the AWS Management Console\.

1. Removes the delete markers by specifying the object keys and version IDs of the delete markers\. The operation deletes the delete markers, which results in the objects reappearing in the AWS Management Console\.

#### [ \.NET ]

The AWS SDK for \.NET provides a convenient method for deleting multiple objects: `DeleteObjects`\. For each object that you want to delete, you specify the key name and the version of the object\. If the bucket is not versioning\-enabled, you specify `null` for the version ID\. If an exception occurs, review the `DeleteObjectsException` response to determine which objects were not deleted and why\. 

**Example Deleting multiple objects from a non\-versioning bucket**  
The following C\# example uses the multi\-object delete API to delete objects from a bucket that is not version\-enabled\. The example uploads the sample objects to the bucket, and then uses the `DeleteObjects` method to delete the objects in a single request\. In the `DeleteObjectsRequest`, the example specifies only the object key names because the version IDs are null\.

**Example Multi\-object deletion for a version\-enabled bucket**  
The following C\# example uses the multi\-object delete API to delete objects from a version\-enabled bucket\. The example performs the following actions:  

1. Creates sample objects and deletes them by specifying the key name and version ID for each object\. The operation deletes specific versions of the objects\.

1. Creates sample objects and deletes them by specifying only the key names\. Because the example doesn't specify version IDs, the operation only adds delete markers\. It doesn't delete any specific versions of the objects\. After deletion, these objects don't appear in the Amazon S3 console\.

1. Deletes the delete markers by specifying the object keys and version IDs of the delete markers\. When the operation deletes the delete markers, the objects reappear in the console\.

#### [ PHP ]

These examples show how to use classes from version 3 of the AWS SDK for PHP to delete multiple objects from versioned and non\-versioned Amazon S3 buckets\. For more information about versioning, see [Using versioning in S3 buckets](Versioning.md)\.

 The examples assume that you are already following the instructions for [Using the AWS SDK for PHP and Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md) and have the AWS SDK for PHP properly installed\.

**Example Deleting multiple objects from a non\-versioned bucket**  
The following PHP example uses the `deleteObjects()` method to delete multiple objects from a bucket that is not version\-enabled\.  
 For information about running the PHP examples in this guide, see [Running PHP Examples](UsingTheMPphpAPI.md#running-php-samples)\.   

```
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\S3Client;

$bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

// 1. Create a few objects.
for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
    $s3->putObject([
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key'    => "key{$i}",
        'Body'   => "content {$i}",
    ]);
}

// 2. List the objects and get the keys.
$keys = $s3->listObjects([
    'Bucket' => $bucket
]); 

// 3. Delete the objects.
foreach ($keys['Contents'] as $key)
{
    $s3->deleteObjects([
        'Bucket'  => $bucket,
        'Delete' => [
