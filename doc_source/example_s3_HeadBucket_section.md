# Determine the existence of an Amazon S3 bucket using an AWS SDK<a name="example_s3_HeadBucket_section"></a>

The following code examples show how to determine the existence of an S3 bucket\.

**Note**  
The source code for these examples is in the [AWS Code Examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples)\. Have feedback on a code example? [Create an Issue](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new/choose) in the code examples repo\.

// It contains S3Client, an Amazon S3 service client that is used to perform bucket

}



// BucketExists checks whether a bucket exists in the current account.
func (basics BucketBasics) BucketExists(bucketName string) (bool, error) {
